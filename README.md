# 🏥 Veyra — Nursing Home Management Backend

**Veyra** is a backend system designed to manage daily operations of nursing homes or assisted living facilities — including residents, staff, activities, and health tracking.  
Built with **Java 25**, **Spring Boot**, **MySQL**, and **Swagger** for REST API documentation.


## 🩺 Overview

**Veyra** provides a clean and maintainable backend for managing:
- Resident profiles & medical histories, etc
- Activities and schedules
- Attendance tracking
- Authentication JWT
- Integration with frontends or mobile apps through RESTful endpoints

The project follows **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles, separating business logic into bounded contexts like:
`NursingHome`, `Residents`, `Activities`, `Staff`.
